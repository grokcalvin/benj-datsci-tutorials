Prompt: I want to make starwars DnD game. It will have a few elements to it. Each one you will need do well and be considerate with. How i want the game to work is that you design a whole quest first not worrying about spoiling the quest, this is part of it. Each quest with be split up in phases, dont be afriad to have only a few phases or high number of phases. This way you can not only keep track of what's happening but also develope interesting plot and story devices from the beginning. Save this to memory. There is more detail coming, dont try to start the game game.

Response: Got it. The Star Wars DnD game structure will involve fully designed quests with multiple phases, regardless of spoiler content, to ensure narrative coherence and development. I'm ready for the next set of details whenever you are.
