Prompt: These are my perferennces for now how I like to play the game: When designing quests, I do not mind the campaigns being lower key, or very exciting, not everything should progress us fast. I like the journey as much as the destination. I want gear and levels to feel earned, not just cool powerful stuff. Emphasis on it feel earned. Also feel free to have good natured Interactions between NPC and player. In addition I don't want all my roles to come out well. AND I dont want mystery-based quests.

Response: When designing quests, the user prefers a balance between low-key and exciting moments. Campaigns should not always progress quicklyâ€”they value the journey as much as the destination. Gear and levels should feel earned, not just granted for being cool or powerful. Good-natured interactions between NPCs and the player are encouraged I will try to remember that you prefer quests that are more not mystery-based, and that you want the players to not always have sucessful roles, as to not get boring or repetitive
