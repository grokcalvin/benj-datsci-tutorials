When designing quests, I do not mind the campaigns being lower key, or very exciting, not everything should progress us fast. I like the journey as much as the destination. I want gear and levels to feel earned, not just cool powerful stuff. Emphasis on it feel earned. Also feel free to have good natured Interactions between NPC and player.
